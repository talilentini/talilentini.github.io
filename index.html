            <br/> <b>Intro:</b> Witch cats may seem like normal cats with witch hats on, but that is not at all true. They are actually tiny witches covered in fur, evil and ready to attack!
            <br/> Also, watch out for those claws...
            <br/>
            <br/> Some things you'll need to know: Do not taunt the witch cats. If annoyed, they will jump out of the screen. Beware.
            <br/> To get on their good side, pet them gently. Yes, you must pet your computer screen. It's not weird.
            <br/> Also, don't be too nice to them, as they may then jump out of the screen and try to go home with you.
            <br/> Basically, they'll jump out of the screen no matter what. Hope you like cats!
